  <h1>Welcome to Turbo's aim training info! :3</h1>
  <p>Aim trainers are video games that are designed with the sole purpose of training your 3D aim for first person shooter games. The main thing that aim trainers are going to do is train your mouse control. Mouse control is esentially how well you can move your computer mouse in order to translate the a specific movement on screen. A few examples of games that would benefit from aim training are Overwatch 2, Apex Legends, Valorant, and Counter Strike. <img src="images/overwatch-nintendo-switch.jpg" alt="Overwatch 2"></p>

  <h2>Types of Aim training scenarios</h2>
  <p>In aim trainers, there are a few types of scenarios that you will find to help you hone your aim skill. These scenarios are divided into three main categories: Clicking, Tracking, and Switching. Clicking is fairly self explanatory. Clicking scenarios have targets that you must click in order to eliminate. Tracking scenarios have moving targets that you must track for a certain period of time. Most tracking scenarios have one target that cannot be eliminated and must be tracked for the entirety of the duration of the task. Switching scenarios have multiple targets that you must track for a certain amount of time to eliminate, and once you eliminate one target you switch to another.</p><img src="images/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="1w6ts clicking scenario">

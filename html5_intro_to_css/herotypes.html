    <h2>What are the diffent types of heroes?</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in <a href="herotypes.html" overwatch="" team="" compositions=""></a> there are three primary types of heroes in Overwatch 2. These being tank, damage, and support. Each role has a different playstyle and well, role, in the team. Tank heroes have high amounts of HP (Health) and create space and bait cooldowns from enemy heroes. Damage heroes primarily deal damage and secure eliminations. Support heroes use their cooldowns to support their team as well as heal them to keep them alive.</p>
    <h3>Subclasses</h3>
    <p>Each hero class has it's own subclasses. In Overwatch 1, tank subclasses were more important but in Overwatch 2 that is not the case so we will not be going over them. The damage role is split into two subclasses, Hitscan DPS and Flex DPS. Hitscan DPS focus on taking longer range engagements and securing eliminations. Flex DPS focus on playing with their tank and helping with close range engagements. The support role is split into Main Support and Flex Support. Main supports tend to not have as high of a healing output, but their abilities tend to be stronger than Flex supports. Likewise, Flex supports tend to have higher healing output while not having as powerful of abilities.</p>
